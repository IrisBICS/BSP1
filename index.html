				<p class="Intro">Welcome! You are on the website created in my first Bachelor Semester Project.</p>
				<p class="Intro">This website is an editing interface for georeferenced data. I have designed this prototype to enable users like you and me to save points of interests on a map. You can pick any point on the map, name the place, add a personal comment, even a long explanation if you want, as well as an image to illustrate it. Then, choose a pin type and color and click on 'Save'. That's it!</p>
				<p class="Intro">Once saved, the places will be displayed in form of pins on the map, as well as in a list. You can view this list either on the map page in a sidebox, or on a separate page if you want to read the information in a more airy space.</p>
				<p class="Intro">Discover all the functionalities that help you to overview and manage your saved points of interests! You can pan the map in just one click to see all pins and choose which pins have to be displayed on the map by checking or unchecking each type of pin. If you want to delete a point of interest, just click on it's pin and press the button 'Delete'. You can even get rid of all pins at once to start everything from new if you want!</p>
				<p class="Intro">Convinced? Click on the big button below access the map page!</p>

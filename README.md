# A Web-based Editing Interface for Georeferenced Data

This repository contains the code of my first bachelor semester project. The repository itself was created long after the end of this project (January 2019).

## Notes

This code uses the Google Maps Javascript API, which requires a key to display the map and provide its features. Please create your own API key and replace "YOUR_KEY" in the code of the map.html page if you wish to use the code properly.
